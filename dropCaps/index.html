            Drop cap or dropped capital is a large capital letter used as a decorative element at the beginning of a
            paragraph or section. The size of a drop cap is usually two or more lines.

            The practice of using a large letter to mark the start of a text has been around for almost two thousand years. Illustrated caps increased
            usability by marking important passages and guiding readers through the text.
